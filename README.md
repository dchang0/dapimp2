Mikey Sklar's DA PIMP 2 reworked into Revision 2.0 to use an OMRON A8L-21-12N2 rocker switch instead of the discontinued Schurter rocker switch.

DANGER: LETHAL SHOCK HAZARD
DO NOT BUILD OR OPERATE THIS CIRCUIT UNLESS YOU TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS USE OR MISUSE
READ MIKEY'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE BEFORE USING THE COMPLETED CIRCUIT
NEITHER MIKEY NOR I BEAR ANY LIABILITY FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS CIRCUIT

IMPORTANT:

I do not provide any support for the DA PIMP 2, and neither does Mikey. If you need help assembling it, then I suggest you ask for assistance from others on the original Instructables page.

For a better design and more support, check out my DIMP 1 and DIMP 2 PCBs on DirtyPCBs.com. The DIMP 1 is designed to be safer and have more accurate voltage readings with a separate multimeter, and the DIMP 2 is an improved DA PIMP 2 with a 4-digit display and slide switches instead of jumpers for choosing the output current.

ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:

Mikey wrote these instructions long ago. The instructions for this Rev. 2.0 PCB are roughly the same. The main differences are the location of the ALPS slide switch and the substitution of an OMRON rocker switch for the original, discontinued Schurter rocker switch.

BILL OF MATERIALS:

Included is an Excel spreadsheet with substitute parts for the ones on Mikey's original BoM. I have not ordered this newer BoM in years, so the parts may or may not be current and may or may not need substitutions. The prices are almost certainly waaaaaay off.

IMPORTANT: 

CONN1 is a 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC barrel jack. You are supposed to assemble CONN1 CABLE: a 5.5mm x 2.1mm barrel plug Y-cable to red and black mini alligator clips. However, neither Mouser nor Digikey carries the two-conductor red/black wire needed to assemble the Y-cable. I thus provided the part numbers for the parts I could find but left the part number blank for the 0.5m of two-conductor red/black wire.

I also provided CONN1 CABLE (ALT), which is/was an ebay listing that sells the cables pre-assembled. I have no affiliation with the ebay seller. The listing might not even exist any more, but there are tons of sellers on ebay and Amazon that sell the same thing.

SCHEMATICS: 

Also included are Mikey's original schematic and the new Rev. 2 schematic. Rev. 2 should be electrically identical to Mikey's original DA PIMP 2 schematic except for the diode, which Mikey got backwards. Rev. 2 corrects the diode's polarity.

GERBER FILES:

The gerber files for the PCB are included in a zip file, ready for you to use to order PCBs with.
The PCB size is 61mm W x 96mm H x 1.6mm D.

FIRMWARE:

Mikey's original firmware file is included. It works on the original DA PIMP 2 as well as this revision 2.

I am also including Mikey's C source code so that you can modify the firmware.

ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Mikey's website is http://mikeysklar.blogspot.com/p/da-pimp-battery-desulfator.html 
I have included a PDF of his website that includes the usage instructions.
